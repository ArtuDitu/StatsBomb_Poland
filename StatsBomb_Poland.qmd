# Introduction

In this document I explore free StatsBomb data from World Cup 2022. I focus on the Polish national team. It is a first time I work with StatsBomb data. My goal is to explore the data and analyze the performance of the team.

# Libraries

Here we load all libraries required to get the data and execute the code in this file.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(StatsBombR)
library(ggplot2)
library(SBpitch)
library(forcats)
```

# Select the data

Select World Cup 2022 (id 43) and events related to only Polish team.

This script can be used to analyze other teams too.

```{r warning=FALSE}
team_to_analyze = "Poland" # specify a team
d <- FreeCompetitions() %>% # load all competitions 
  filter(competition_id == 43 & season_name == 2022) %>% # select World Cup 2022
  FreeMatches() %>% # load all matches
  filter(home_team.home_team_name == team_to_analyze | away_team.away_team_name == team_to_analyze) %>% # select matchs of Polish team
  free_allevents(Parallel = T) %>% #load all events
  allclean() # calculate additional variables from existings ones (StatsBomb function to improve dataset)

# create a data frame that has info about opponents of chosen team
d_opponents <- FreeCompetitions() %>% # load all competitions
  filter(competition_id == 43 & season_name == 2022) %>% # select World Cup 2022
  FreeMatches() %>% # load all matches
  filter(home_team.home_team_name == team_to_analyze | away_team.away_team_name == team_to_analyze) %>%  # select matchs of Polish team
  select(match_id, match_date, home_team.home_team_name, away_team.away_team_name) %>%
  distinct() %>% # select only relevant variables
  mutate(opponent = case_when(home_team.home_team_name == team_to_analyze ~ away_team.away_team_name,
                              away_team.away_team_name == team_to_analyze ~ home_team.home_team_name)) # create a new variable that will contain info who was an opponent in each game

#merge both datasets to have info about the opponent for each event
d <- inner_join(d, d_opponents, by="match_id")
```

# Analysis

## Shots

First I look at all shots of Polish team.

Each color represents different opponent and the size of the shot location represents xG (statsbomb).

```{r}
d_shots <- filter(d, team.id == 789 & type.id == 16) # select only shots of Polish team

create_Pitch(goaltype = "box") +
  geom_point(data = d_shots, aes(x = location.x, y = location.y, 
                                 colour = opponent, 
                                 size = shot.statsbomb_xg))+
  ggtitle("Shots - Poland World Cup 2022")+
  labs(colour = "Opponent")+
  guides(size = "none")+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.15, 0.8),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1,vjust = -2),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F9F9F9"))
```
